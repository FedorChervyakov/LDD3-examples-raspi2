Linux Device Drivers 3 (http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/) book is now a few years
old and most of the example drivers do not compile in recent kernels.

The original code can be found at: http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596005900/

Linux Device Drivers 3 examples updated to work with kernel 4.15 now. 
These could be run on Ubuntu 16.04 / Ubuntu 18.04
